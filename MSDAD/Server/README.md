# Instructions on how to run a Server
The Server.exe file is in bin/Debug/

Run in command line:
``Server.exe <serverId> <serverUrl> <maxFaults> <minDelay> <maxDelay> <roomsFile> [<numServers> <serversUrls>]``

We assume that if the servers are created manually without the PuppetMaster, they will receive the urls of all the other servers.
